# Yet Another PYANG
An open source Python package that helps developers to translate YANG (RFC6020/RFC7950) data models to Python. YAPYANG mimics the functionality of YANG data structures, enforces types through annotations, and supports JSON/XML ser/des. YAPYANG is authored by [Antonio Faria](https://github.com/movedempackets), governed as a [benevolent dictatorship](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and distributed under [license](LICENSE)


> [!WARNING]
> YAPYANG is in construction, during this time no effort shall be afforded to migrations and backwards compatibility. See [versioning](#versioning).

## Versioning
Releases will follow semantic versioning (major.minor.patch). Before 1.0.0 breaking changes can be included in a minor release, therefore we highly recommend pinning this package.
